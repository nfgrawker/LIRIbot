Give two arguments, one to do what you want and the second to search for your term. concert = bandname, spotify = trackname, movie = movie title. If using do-what-it-says just include the filename and no other argument(this file should be text and consist of two arguments seperated by comma)


I created 4 functions to support command line **concert-this**,**spotify-this-song**, and **movie-this** and **do-what-it-says**.
an if statement takes any of these and links it to a function, if not one of these program returns "did not understand your command"
