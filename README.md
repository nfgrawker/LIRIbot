# LIRIbot
Give two arguments, one to do what you want and the second to search for your term
I created 4 functions to support command line #concert-this, #spotify-this-song, and #movie-this and do-what-it-says.
an if statement takes any of these and links it to a function, if not one of these program returns "did not understand your command"
